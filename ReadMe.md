> ## Technologies Used

 | <b><u>Stack</u></b> | <b><u>Usage Summary</u></b> |
 | :------------------ | :------------------------- |
 | **`Base OnChainKit`**       | Base smart wallet, smart contract calls, transactions       |
 | **`Base chain`** | Main contracts deployed/diferent dao voting logic |
 | **`Solidity`**      | Smart contract             |
 | **`React`**         | Frontend                   |

- ### **Solidity smart contracts**
    Citizen makes use of the different voting smart contracts of the daos that list their products on our platform, on listing the provide their contract ABI, Function name and contract address which we would use with base onChainkit to interact with the vot function in their contracts


- ### **Base Chain**
    - The Dao contract are <b style="color: orange"> to be deployed on</b> this chain 


- ### **Base OnChainKit**
    - <b style="color: orange">The Base OnChainkit</b>  was used to handle our base smart wallet, contract interaction and transaction functions.
